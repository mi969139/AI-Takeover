## AI-Takeover
*It's fine when it's not your job on the line.*

**Artist Statement:**
  For this project, I wanted to go with the overall theme of AI taking over human jobs. There is this fear that artists, writers, and developers will soon be replaced with generative AI programs, as they are typically cheaper for businesses over human staff. This in turn puts people out of jobs. However, whenever the people effected bring up their concerns online, it is common that people outside of the creative field begin to turn hostile, and say that maybe they deserve this treatment since it's unfair that not everyone can create like creatives can. For my pieces, I wanted to explore what it would be like if AI took over jobs outside of the creative field, and it makes me wonder how those people that were so hostile would feel if the shoe was on the other foot, and they were the ones out of a job. Would they cause the same uproar? Would they be just as scared of the uncertainty? AI is fine, so long as it's not your job on the line, right? 
  This project takes viewers through various industries outside of the creative field, in a world where AI has begun to replace human-roles in the workforce and taken control. From automotive repair to medical assistance, this project highlights the impact of AI on everyday lives and jobs. Each piece in the collection is serves as a snapshot of a job, task, or role that was once originally performed by a human, but now portrayed as if it were being taken over by an AI-controlled robot. "AI-Takeover" is a call out of the impact of job-displacement in the creative field, and asks the question if we should be so reliant on allowing AI to take over creative roles. 
  My background as a creative is what drove me to think about this project. Every day I worry my pool of potential jobs will shrink and dry up (moreso than they already have), all because I worry companies will become so reliant on how cheap AI can be compared to artists/developers. I've heard rumors of this being the case in some companies, where they replaced their artists with prompters, all in the sake of cutting costs. I've seen the rants of non-creatives online, how we're "gatekeeping" art as if we were born out the womb with the ability to paint masterpieces. It feels like they discredit the work and skill we built up over years of practice, just to make a jab at how they can replicate our works with little effort. I believe AI can be used in the creative process, especially for those like my out there who suffer from Aphantasia (the inability to see things in your mind) when it comes to getting ideas together, but I firmly believe it shouldn't be a replacement for artists entirely. 

**Configuration:**
    For this project, I used Midjourney, so there wasn't really much I could change in regards to settings. Since Midjourney no longer allows free-users, I did pay for their premium subscription just to be able to generate the images, which would allow me to upscale, create variants, or re-roll the generations as I found necessary. To ensure my prompts were easy to read by Midjourney, I explained what I wanted into ChatGPT3.5, and it generated a prompt I could plug into midjourney. While this method worked most of the time, there were instances where I had to go in myself and tweak the prompt to guide the AI more towards what I wanted. 

An example of one of the prompts put into ChatGPT3.5 and its output were:
    Input: Please write a generative image ai prompt for robots working as a courtroom judge in place of a human judge
    Output: Generate an image portraying a futuristic courtroom where a robotic judge presides over legal proceedings, symbolizing the intersection of law and technology in the pursuit of justice. Visualize a solemn courtroom setting with polished wooden benches, legal documents, and an attentive audience. Picture a humanoid robot seated on a raised dais, clad in judicial robes and emanating an aura of impartiality and authority. Show the robot presiding over a trial, with lawyers presenting arguments and witnesses providing testimony. Illustrate the robot's capability to analyze evidence, interpret laws, and deliver fair judgments based on legal principles and precedents. Integrate futuristic elements such as holographic displays for case evidence, AI-driven legal research assistants, and real-time language translation capabilities to ensure equitable access to justice. Capture the essence of judicial integrity and the promise of unbiased decision-making in the era of robotic justice.

**Past Work Influence:**
  While no specific project directly influenced my overall theme of my project, the previous image generative projects did guide me towards which image generator I ended up using. I was considering using Dreamstudio again, but I was out of credits and did not want to pay for more (though I guess it didn't really matter because I paid the same amount to be able to use Midjourney...). This project moreso is based off of my current feelings for generative AI, in which I think it should be used as a resource for ideas, not for replacement entirely.
